        <h3>The Wandering Comma</h3>
        <p class="project-head">
          A developer's work is never done -- especially not when it comes to learning new things. I wanted a place where I could make posts about what I am learning, thoughts on coding, etc. The blog needed to exercise and hone my skills in creating a full stack application. This application allows for users to sign up, login in, and create and edit posts and comments. This application encrypts passwords and stores them hashed securely in the database. I plan to add more features to this application over time, like the ability to add photos. Watch for more to come!

        <h3>Weather Dashboard</h3>
        <p class="project-head">
          A weather tracking website that uses fetch API and localStorage. Needed a site where weather searches were saved so that the user could easily check weather updates while they are traveling.

        <h2>Home Party</h2>
        <p>
          A full-stack website built collaboratively. Home Party is a place to invite your family and friends; a place
          where you can keep track of all your favorite homes... and everything you could put in them.
        </p>
        <p class="project-head">
          It was an awesome experience to have built a full stack website from conception to end product. I and my team
          learned so much and got so much on the ground experience navigating complex routes and inter-connected table
          structures. We learned about the tech "Node Mailer" as well as deepened our experience with <strong>Express,
            Sequelize, MySQL2, Handlebars, Bootstrap, CSS, Javascript, and HTML5</strong>.

        <h2>A Night In</h2>
        <p>
          I worked with a team of two other awesome coders to learn about APIs
          and generating HTML. We wanted to build a site where searching for
          ideas for a night in would be fun and more focused than doing
          numerous searches in different browser windows for food, drinks, and
          entertainment.
        </p>
        <p class="project-head">
          For my teammates and I, it was an awesome experience to learn about
          APIs and fetch commands. Our skills were honed and tested. Learn
          more at our GitHub repo!

        <h2>eCommerce Back End</h2>
        <p>
          Being able to manage databases for eCommerce is complicated and needs well written code and logical
          data-handling. This project addresses the essential needs of managing categories of products, products, and
          tag words that will make it easier for a shopper to find what they are looking for. This is a purely back end
          exercise, so please check out the video linked above to see how the application functions. With this
          application, a user is able to create, read, update, and delete products, categories, and product tags.
          <strong>Used Javascript, Inquierer, Express, MySQL2, and Sequelize.</strong>
        </p>
        <p class="project-head">
          The video above is a demo of the program's functionality.
