        <h3>The Wandering Comma</h3>
        <p class="project-head">
          A developer's work is never done -- especially not when it comes to learning new things. I wanted a place
          where I could make posts about what I am learning, thoughts on coding, etc. The blog needed to exercise and
          hone my skills in creating a full stack application. This application allows for users to sign up, login in,
          and create and edit posts and comments. This application encrypts passwords and stores them hashed securely in
          the database. I plan to add more features to this application over time, like the ability to add photos. Watch
          for more to come!

        <p class="project-head">
          A full stack PWA text editor that creates an easy place to keep coding notes or practice functions. It can be used in the browser and also saved to your local device. It uses Idb and/or localStorage to keep the notes you input.

        <h2>Home Party</h2>
        <p>
          A full-stack website built collaboratively. Home Party is a place to invite your family and friends; a place
          where you can keep track of all your favorite homes... and everything you could put in them.
        </p>
        <p class="project-head">
          It was an awesome experience to have built a full stack website from conception to end product. I and my team
          learned so much and got so much on the ground experience navigating complex routes and inter-connected table
          structures. We learned about the tech "Node Mailer" as well as deepened our experience with <strong>Express,
            Sequelize, MySQL2, Handlebars, Bootstrap, CSS, Javascript, and HTML5</strong>.

        <h2>A Night In</h2>
        <p>
          I worked with a team of two other awesome coders to learn about APIs
          and generating HTML. We wanted to build a site where searching for
          ideas for a night in would be fun and more focused than doing
          numerous searches in different browser windows for food, drinks, and
          entertainment.
        </p>
        <p class="project-head">
          For my teammates and I, it was an awesome experience to learn about
          APIs and fetch commands. Our skills were honed and tested. Learn
          more at our GitHub repo!
